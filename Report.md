# Project  Report


In this project, the Deep Q-Learning algorithm is implemented to train an agent for navigating itself. 

### Environment
Unity's ML Agents package is utilized in the project to train the agent on the environment named Banana. In this environment, yellow and blue bananas are randomly placed on the platform. Moreover, position of the agent is also randomly determined. This agent perceives a 37-dimensional vector as its own state. Velocity and the ray-based observations are kept in the state.

### Methodology
The Deep Q-Learning is an algorithm to find out the Q values.
